## Description
When creating an open source project on GitHub, itâ€™s important to have a high-quality README. A high-quality README should include a description on what the app is for, how to use the app, how to install it, how to report issues, and how to make contributions. 

This application quickly and easily creates a professional README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This application was created with the hopes that it can allow the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.
